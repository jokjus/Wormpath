# WormPath
 Draw 'worms' along vector paths with parametrized brush block.

## Path source
 Modify images/pathsource.svg in eg. Adobe Illustrator. SVG should ONLY contain paths in a single layer, not groups, not compound paths. So, release those compound paths and ungroup your groups. Keep it simple.

## What works
 Regular fonts don't work as you would think, because they are not made of single strokes. So you need to either draw your own, or use other solutions, for example https://www.templatemaker.nl/singlelinetext/

## Export SVG
 Probably only works with very slow density and low line count. Screenshots are the way to go right now.

## Presets
 Hard coded for now.

## Know issues
 Drawing disappears on resize. Just change any value to redraw.
